IoT enabled risk monitoring system in Cold Supply Chain

The IoT-enabled risk monitoring system for the cold supply chain aims to provide a comprehensive solution to the challenges faced in monitoring temperature-controlled products' transportation and delivery. The proposed system utilizes advanced modules, such as PIR & GAS Sensor, Camera, Stepper Motor, ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module, Keypad Interfacing, Humidity Info, Temperature Info, and LPC2148 & LPC1768, to provide accurate and real-time data, enabling stakeholders to take immediate action and prevent any potential damage. The system's advanced features, such as automatic route optimization, real-time tracking of vehicles, and user-friendly dashboard, make it an essential tool for any organisation involved in the cold supply chain.
